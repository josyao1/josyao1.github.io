Here's an updated README with a brief explanation of how you set up the site on GitHub Pages:

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, learning experiences, and more. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of Bootstrap for styling and Font Awesome for icons.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive layout and styling. You can find more about Bootstrap [here](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- **Font Awesome**: Used for icons. You can learn more about Font Awesome [here](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Running the Website Locally

To run the website locally, simply download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Setting Up on GitHub Pages

To host the website online, I used GitHub Pages. Here's a quick overview of the setup:

1. **Repository Creation**: I created a repository named `josyao1.github.io` on GitHub. The repository name follows the pattern `username.github.io` to automatically enable GitHub Pages.
2. **File Upload**: I uploaded all my project files, including HTML, CSS, JS, and other assets, to the repository.
3. **Deployment**: Since the repository is named correctly, GitHub Pages automatically deploys the `index.html` file as the homepage. Any updates pushed to the `main` branch are immediately reflected on the live site.

This simple setup allows the website to be accessible online without the need for a custom server or domain.
