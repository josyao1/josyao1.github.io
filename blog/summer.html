            <p>This summer, I took significant steps towards preparing for both academic research and the professional world. As a rising junior in college, I knew that building a strong foundation in both areas would be crucial for my future aspirations, whether in pursuing a master's or PhD, or in entering the workforce. I dedicated my time to several key projects that not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me invaluable lessons in project management, self-discipline, and professional readiness.</p>

            <h2>SomethingSold: Leading a Development Team</h2>
            <p>One of the most impactful experiences this summer was my work on SomethingSold, a college-specific platform for buying and selling second-hand furniture. As the back-end development team lead, I had the opportunity to manage the technical aspects of our project. I was responsible for integrating AWS services like Cognito for secure user authentication, and ensuring our database operations were efficient and scalable. Beyond the technical challenges, this project taught me the importance of clear communication with the front-end team and the value of presenting progress regularly to my teammates. These weekly updates not only kept everyone aligned but also helped me develop my ability to convey complex technical information in a way that was accessible to all team members. The project sharpened my leadership skills and deepened my understanding of how to balance technical and managerial responsibilities.</p>

            <h2>Sentiment & Number Recognition: Independent Research and Learning</h2>
            <p>Another significant project was my work on a sentiment analysis and number recognition web app. This project was a deep dive into machine learning, where I implemented models using TensorFlow and Keras. Unlike SomethingSold, this project was largely self-guided, which required me to hold myself accountable to my own deadlines. The process of researching, implementing, and testing these models taught me how to be an independent learner and researcher. I learned to navigate the vast amount of resources available online, to filter out what was useful, and to integrate it into my work. This project also improved my ability to troubleshoot and refine my code, as I often had to debug issues on my own without immediate guidance. This experience has been instrumental in preparing me for future research projects, where self-motivation and independent problem-solving are key.</p>

            <h2>Building My Portfolio Website: Learning HTML and More</h2>
            <p>As part of a summer class, I also developed this portfolio website to showcase my projects and experiences. This was my first comprehensive introduction to web development, and I learned a great deal about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building the website from scratch was a rewarding experience, as it allowed me to see how each line of code contributed to the final product. It also gave me a new appreciation for user experience design and the importance of creating a site that is both functional and visually appealing. This project was a perfect example of how learning something new can have immediate practical applications—this website is now a key tool in my professional portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Job Applications and LeetCode: A Taste of the Professional World</h2>
            <p>In addition to my project work, I also spent time preparing for my future career by applying for internships and practicing coding problems on LeetCode. This was my first real exposure to the professional interview process, and it was both challenging and enlightening. The experience of completing online assessments and coding challenges taught me the importance of time management and precision. It also highlighted areas where I can improve, such as optimizing my problem-solving approach and brushing up on certain algorithms. These efforts have already paid off in terms of increased confidence and readiness for future interviews.</p>
